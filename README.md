- Press button M to turn on/off anti-aliasing
- Press button B to switch between Phong and Blinn-Phong model of lighting
- Press C to switch between regular shading and skybox shader
- Press N to switch between normal mapping and regular maping with normals from verteces
- Press P to turn on/off parallax mapping (only works if normal mapping is on)
- Press E-Q to change height scale on parralax mapping (only visible if parralax mapping is on)
